# FER_Election_Debates
Face emotion Recognition applied to Election Debates in Spain

This project contains the code that was used to research on the use of facial emotions by Spanish politicians in the 2019 and 2023 election debates.
The project contains two files: the first "training" contains the code used to train face_recognition with the faces of Spanish politicians.
The second "detection" contains the code used to extract the Opencv and FER encodings. The result is a csv file with the file, second, detected face and emotion of each second of each video file.
